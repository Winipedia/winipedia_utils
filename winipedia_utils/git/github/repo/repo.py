            signatures.
        pull_request: Require all commits be made to a non-target branch and
            submitted via a pull request.
        required_status_checks: Choose which status checks must pass before the
            ref is updated.
        non_fast_forward: Prevent users with push access from force pushing to
            refs.
        commit_message_pattern: Parameters to be used for the
